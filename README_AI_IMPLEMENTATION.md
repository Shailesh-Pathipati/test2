### 2. Environment Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your AWS credentials and endpoints
3. Configure API Gateway URLs

### 3. Lambda Functions Deployment
Deploy the following Lambda functions:
- `cat-central-chat-processor`
- `cat-central-parts-finder`
- `cat-central-fault-analyzer`
- `cat-central-image-processor`
- `cat-central-voice-processor`
- `cat-central-recommendations`

### 4. Database Setup
1. Create DynamoDB tables for:
   - User profiles
   - Equipment data
   - Parts catalog
   - Fault codes
   - Analytics

2. Set up OpenSearch domain for parts search

### 5. Model Training
1. Train custom Rekognition models for part identification
2. Set up Personalize campaigns for recommendations
3. Configure Bedrock with Cat-specific knowledge base

## API Endpoints

### Chat Processing
```
POST /chat
{
  "message": "Find oil filters for CAT320D",
  "context": {
    "userId": "user123",
    "equipmentSerialNumbers": ["CAT12345"]
  }
}
```

### Parts Search
```
POST /parts/find
{
  "equipmentSerial": "CAT12345",
  "searchQuery": "oil filter",
  "partType": "filter"
}
```

### Fault Code Analysis
```
POST /fault-codes/analyze
{
  "faultCode": "E12345",
  "equipmentSerial": "CAT12345"
}
```

### Image Processing
```
POST /parts/identify
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- image: [image file]
- equipmentContext: "CAT320D"
```
